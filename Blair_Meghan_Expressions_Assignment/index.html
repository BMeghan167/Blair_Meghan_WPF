<body>You own a candy shop where your three biggest sellers are Butterscotch, Taffy, and Tootsie Rolls. The shipment
of your candy comes in three bags for each one. You need to know the total amount of candy before the day can start.
During the day, a group of children come in and buy one of your bags of tootsie rolls containing 178 pieces. Now you
need to know how much candy you have left total.
