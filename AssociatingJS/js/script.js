//Conditional Logic - With an expression

//if the child is old enough, print to the console "you can ride!"
// if the kid is over 48" in height
if(kidHeight > minHeight){
    //code performed if condition is true
    console.log("You can ride the coaster!");
}else{
    //code is performed if condition is false
    console.log("Sorry kid, you've got some growing to do!")
